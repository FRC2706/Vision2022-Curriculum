# Vision2022-Curriculum
The vision curriculum

This repository is for Merge Robotics, 2022-2023 Season

We will be working through the tasks located in each week's folder, to:

- Learn Python
- Learn how to use Github
- Learn to use VSCode to develop code for our computers and for raspberry pi
- Learn the basic of vision processing using the powerful OpenCV open source library to solve a typical FRC vision challenge
- New to 2022!!  We will be using OpenCV tools to find April tags which will be used in the game this year

The basic workflow for FRC vision is Good Image, Good Mask and good Math. Let's call this "GIGMM"! An acronym to remember the workflow.

We will not need a robot, or specific hardware, other than a computer with Python, OpenCV and VSCode.
