# This is a pseudo code file for Merge Robotics

# This is task K - > Blank regions of no interest.  We have discussed the notion
# that there are areas of the image that will never contain information that we want
# our code to process.  Using online search engines find a way using OpenCV to
# modify a photo to contain black pixels in areas with no interest to our code

# Previous tasks can be copied here and modified, this should be a quick effort
