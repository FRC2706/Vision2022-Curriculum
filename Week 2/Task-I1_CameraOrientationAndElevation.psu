# This is task I1 - > Camera Orientation and Elevation.  Before the first 3 weeks of build season has
# passed the location of cameras on the robot will likely be decided and/or our choices will be limited.
# During the first 2 of build season is when we can take time to consider camera orientation and 
# elevation and influence it as much as possible on the physical robot.  Generally a vertical difference
# between the camera and vision targets is helpful for certain math.  It also permits more calculations
# in some cases.  We will plan to show this in a live demo and discuss more.  If you have your own webcam
# at home, please experiment with your code by looking at targets with portrait and landscape orientations.
