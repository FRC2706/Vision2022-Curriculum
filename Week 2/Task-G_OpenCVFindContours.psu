# This is a pseudo code file for Merge Robotics

# This is task G - > Find Contours.  This is a seemingly simple command. But is where the real math begins.  
# The command basically converts the masked image into arrays of coordinates that we do math on.  Make sure
# you can do this in your code.  You need to end up with a set of contours!  If you print them to the console
# you will see pages and pages of coordinates go by.  Do that at least once.
